                Today we are an established, industry leading
                full-service machine shop. Though it has not 
                always been this way. Joe Porterfield founded 
                Solutions Machining over 30 years ago in his 
                residential garage. Joe's garage was the corner
                stone for our growing success today. When 
                Joe Porterfield founded the company in Arvada,
                Colorado, he bought two small manual machines. 
                The machines he bought were, a single table
                Bridgeport Mill and the other was a small six-inch
                chuck, extended bed, LeBlond Lathe. We still have
                the Bridgeport Mill in the back of the shop as a
                memorial to Joe's hard-work and dedication that
                Solutions Machine was founded upon. (Yes, it is 
                still fully-functional!) These values of hard-work 
                and honesty live on in the shop and are still at 
                the core of our team today. 

                Ownership of Solutions Machining has always been
                passed down to former employees. Today 
                Dale Williamson, a former employee with fifteen 
                years of service, is now at the lead of our team 
                as owner/manager. Dale has invested in and grown 
                Solutions Machine considerably as we now service 
                our customers with over ten CNC programmable 
                machining centers from industry leading suppliers, 
                such as <a href="https://us.dmgmori.com/" target="_blank">Mori-Seiki</a> and <a href="https://www.mazakusa.com/" target="_blank">Mazak</a>. We are still based
                out of Arvada, Colorado and we continue to serve 
                multiple original customers. Customers that Joe
                once had the pleasure servicing. Visit our "Contact Us"

                Hello and Thank You for your interest in our Team. My 
                name is Dale Williamson, Owner/Manager of Solutions 
                Machine, Inc. I'm a Colorado native and possess a deep 
                appreciation for this state. In my younger years I was 
                an avid outdoors man of many activities, ranging from 
                guiding raft trips to extended through hiking. I have always 
                had an entrepreneur drive as this is my third attempt at 
                business ownership. My past two attempts had not succeeded. 
                Though, I was not willing to give up. A good entrepreneur 
                is not discouraged by failure but learns from it.
            </p>            
            <p class="p6_body1">    
                I have successfully owned and managed Solutions Machining
                for over fifteen years now. I'm still gracious for 
                the opportunity to do so. It is my promise to my customers 
                and employees that we will continue to be at the cutting 
                edge of industry standards, to meet and exceed their needs. 
                My employees are what make the difference here by 
                comparison to other shops and I value each of them greatly. 
                They are the driving force behind our excellent customer 
                satisfaction.
